                We absolutely love Craftsvilla! The activities are varied and interesting. On at least one occasion my
                son has been so proud of his creation that he’s taken it to bed with him. Can’t recommend it enough.

                It’s such a lovely environment to be in where mums can have a chat while creating beautiful memories of
                our little ones.

                This was the most enjoyable experience. Carrie makes an art night with friends enjoyable, interesting
                and FUN!
                A formidable artist herself, she also has the gift of being a great teacher. Thank you Carrie!

                Awesome and knowledgeable instructors and assistant instructors! They are very helpful for those who are
                beginners.

                What a fun and unique experience we had at your studio! We really enjoyed doing something creative as a
                group. We’ll definitely recommend the rest of the company to come and have some fun!

                Thank you so much for your care and guidance. It has meant a lot to my daughters growth and confidence.
                She loves her lessons, sees herself as an artist and sees this as a talent she can use for good.
